## The perfect soundtrack for any task

A jukebox for your state of mind. Tune the pitch and tempo to find your brain's secret internal rhythm and unlock a new level of focus. But be careful â€“ this amount of productivity can be powerful and addictive.

## An exceptional playlist

Thoughtfully curated over two decades, Crunchy's playlist features the best tunes from the classic 90's [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) era and beyond. Cracktro, chiptune, "house", BGM and more, from timeless community favourites to forgotten masterpieces and undiscovered gems. 

Notably, every track is ***Reliable***: that is, they should all play correctly at any pitch/tempo combination.

### Tuning tips

Tuning is optional, but it only takes a minute to optimize Crunchy for your work session:

- Find an upbeat track [[1](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=125550)][[2](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=68825)][[3](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=191252)]
- Adjust the tempo until you're **bobbing your head comfortably**. It shouldn't feel like it's rushing you or slowing you down.
- Adjust the pitch until you feel **tingles down your neck** and throughout your body. Find the sweet spot where the tingles persist as you bob your head.
- Adjust the volume until it's **almost too loud** but still comfortable and safe. You may feel some euphoria here.
- If tuned correctly: you should now be completing your task! See you in x hours.
