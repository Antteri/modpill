## The perfect soundtrack for any task

You've done enough studying and relaxing; now it's time to get things done. Tune the pitch and tempo to find your brain's secret internal rhythm and unlock a powerful new level of focus. But be careful â€“ this amount of productivity can be addictive.

## An exceptional playlist

Thoughtfully curated over two decades, Crunchy's playlist selects from the best tunes of the classic 90's [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) era and beyond. Cracktro, chiptune, fresh house, dark house, BGM and more, from timeless community favourites [[1](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=40475)][[2](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=159181)][[3](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=57925)] to deep cuts and undiscovered gems [[4](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=74977)][[5](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=123241)][[6](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=104419)].

Notably, every track is ***Reliable***: that is, it'll play correctly at any pitch/tempo combination. Many great MOD files break down and become unlistenable when played at different pitches/tempos, but they've been carefully pruned from the collection.

### Tuning tips

Tuning is optional, but it only takes a minute to optimize Crunchy for your work session:

- Find an upbeat track [[7](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=125550)][[8](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=68825)][[9](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy?track=191252)]
- Adjust the tempo until you're **bobbing your head comfortably**. It shouldn't feel like it's rushing you or slowing you down.
- Adjust the pitch until you feel **tingles down your neck** and throughout your body. Find the sweet spot where the tingles persist as you bob your head.
- Increase the volume until it's **almost too loud** but still comfortable and safe. You may feel some euphoria here.
- If tuned correctly: you should now be completing your task! See you in x hours.
