# Crunchy Reliable Beats

200+ of the crunchiest, MOST reliable beats from the golden age of Amiga MODs. Demoscene, cracktro, house, chiptune, BGM and more, featuring timeless community favourites and plenty of deep cuts.

## The perfect soundtrack for any task!

Tune your experience to your state of mind: finely control the pitch and tempo to match your current rhythm of thought, and zone into your work like never before. Better than Adderall? That's what some listeners have asked.

Try it out for yourself – put on a pair of wireless noise-cancelling headphones and **[get something done.](https://www.mirthturtle.com/crunchy-reliable-beats/)**
